You are a DevOps engineer at XYZ Ltd. Your company is working on a Java application and wants to automate WAR file artifact deployment so that 
they donâ€™t have to perform WAR deployment on Tomcat/Jetty web containers. Automate Ansible integration with Jenkins CI server so that we can 
run and execute playbooks to deploy custom WAR files to a web container and then perform restart for the web container.

 

Steps to Perform:

Perform manual configuration of Jenkins and Ansible on 1 server
- Exercise 9.1, TODO#2 -on master-control-server #Install ansible
- Install Jenkins -on master-control-server.    #Install Jenkins
- Install Jenkins Ansible plugin
- Install and configure Maven on Jenkins

Install Ansible plugins in Jenkins CI server
- Configure Ansbile to work on Jenkins


Prepare Ansible playbook to run Maven build on Jenkins CI server
- Download War project from https://start.spring.io/
- Put War project in Github
- Setup Jenkins to pull from Github repo and build project using maven

Prepare Ansible playbook to execute deployment steps on the remote web container with restart of the web container post deployment
- Create a playbook that copies the artifact from jenkins build
- Move artifact to remote server on AWS.
